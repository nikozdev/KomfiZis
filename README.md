# KomfiZis - My Comfortable System

This is a repository for personal computer setups of NikoZDev:
- The directory "/linux" for setting up GNU/Linux operating systems;
- The directory "/macos" for setting up MacOs operating systems;
- The directory "/winos" for setting up Windows operating systems;

Each system directory:
- Should contain files organised like a map onto targeted filesystems;
- Needs a setup script to install|uninstall packages, sync files;
